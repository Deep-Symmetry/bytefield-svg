= Introduction
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

This tool was created to enable the porting of a pair of large LaTeX
documents to a more modern and maintainable
https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoc]-based https://antora.org[Antora]
site. The only thing I couldn’t do without was the wonderful
`bytefield` LaTeX package for drawing byte field diagrams, and
`bytefield-svg` was my way to bring it forward to this new world.
https://djl-analysis.deepsymmetry.org/djl-analysis/track_metadata.html#_connecting_to_the_database[It
worked wonderfully.]

Along the way, I switched from LaTeX-style commands to using
https://clojure.org[Clojure] to build my own domain-specific language
for expressing byte field diagrams. Having the full power of a modern
Lisp made the diagram source a lot more compact and faster to write,
and it is easy to define your own helper functions to eliminate
repetitive writing.

Clojure’s rich set of native data types (including keywords,
https://clojure.org/reference/reader#_vectors[vectors],
https://clojure.org/reference/reader#_maps[maps], and
https://clojure.org/reference/reader#_sets[sets]), and compact way of
representing them in source, are a big part of why this worked so
well.

[TIP]
====
But this means that to get really productive with
`bytefield-svg`, you are going to need to
https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[learn] at least a little
Clojure.

Here is an introduction to the
https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax[syntax], a
https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet[cheat sheet] and some help
deciphering what will initially look like strange
https://clojure.org/guides/weird_characters[characters] that are hard
to search for on the web.

The https://github.com/borkdude/sci[sci] interpreter that runs your
`bytefield-svg` source offers a large subset of the language, with the
omission of host interop features and a few functions which would be
dangerous in a shared hosting environment.

[[drawing-model]]
## The Drawing Model

The basic purpose of `bytefield-svg` is to support the drawing of
byte-field diagrams to aid in the understanding of network protocols,
memory layouts, and similar binary structures. It sets up a drawing
environment to facilitate that, as well as the automatic generation of
column and row headers to help readers keep track of byte addresses.

Reasonable defaults are provideded, but everything is very
configurable. Before diving into those details, it will help to look
at some concrete examples. The main function you’ll use for drawing
byte boxes is <<funcs.adoc#draw-box,`draw-box`>>. By default it creates a
box that represents one byte. So if we create a diagram with only
`(draw-box 0)` as its content, here is what we get:

[bytefield]
----
(draw-box 0)
----

Notice that the value is represented as two hexadecimal digits, to
reinforce that it is a single byte. But why is it positioned where it
is? We can get a hint of that if we draw the column headers before
calling it. So, a slightly more full-featured diagram specification
would be:

[source,clojure]
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box 0)

[bytefield]
----
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box 0)
----

That’s more clear: The diagram is configured to show sixteen byte
boxes per row, which is why our box was drawn where it is. The diagram
is centered, as well (although there is room on the left for row
address headers, which will appear when the diagram grows beyond one
row).

But why were the column headers not drawn until we explicitly asked
for them? That is to give us a chance to change things like the number
of boxes per row and the left margin before we start drawing. Those
values are set up as defaults, but can be changed by calling `def` (a
standard Clojure function{empty}footnote:[Technically, `def` is
actually a _special form_ rather than a function, but that is further
afield than this introduction needs to go.]) with the symbol of the
setting we want to define or redefine, and the value we want to give
it, like so:

[source,clojure]
(def left-margin 1)
(def boxes-per-row 4)
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box 0)

[bytefield]
----
(def left-margin 1)
(def boxes-per-row 4)
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box 0)
----

That gives us a nicely centered diagram with four byte boxes per row.

If you have to draw a lot of values in a sequence, you can use normal
Clojure sequence handling forms like
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doseq[`doseq`]:

[source,clojure]
(draw-column-headers)
(doseq [val (range 30)]
  (draw-box val))

[bytefield]
----
(draw-column-headers)
(doseq [val (range 30)]
  (draw-box val))
----

And we get thirty boxes containing the numbers from 0 to 29 expressed
in hexadecimal.

For situations where you have a series of bytes that you want to
convey are part of a related structure, you can use the
<<funcs.adoc#draw-related-boxes,`draw-related-boxes`>> function. It takes a
sequence as its first argument, and does the looping for you, in
addition to using dashed borders inside the related group:

[source,clojure]
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-related-boxes (range 30))

[bytefield]
----
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-related-boxes (range 30))
----

Of course, sometimes we have values that take more than one byte, and
sometimes we want to draw labels describing their contents, rather
than just showing values. If you pass a string rather than a number,
it is drawn as a label. And `draw-box` takes a second argument after
the box content, which is a map of attributes, identified by keyword,
that modify the box. The `:span` attribute controls how many bytes
wide the box should be, with a default value of 1. Putting that
together, and using a new <<funcs.adoc#draw-gap,`draw-gap`>> function which
is designed to communicate variable-length structures, we can draw
something like this:

[source,clojure]
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box "Address" {:span 4})
(draw-box "Size" {:span 2})
(draw-box 0 {:span 2})
(draw-gap "Payload")
(draw-bottom)

[bytefield]
----
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box "Address" {:span 4})
(draw-box "Size" {:span 2})
(draw-box 0 {:span 2})
(draw-gap "Payload")
(draw-bottom)
----

> We had to call `draw-bottom` at the end, because sometimes we want
  control over the border at the bottom of a gap, which will become
  more clear in the discussion of box borders.

Note that the third box we drew, which we labeled with a number, was
drawn using four hex digits, because we told it to span two byte
boxes, and that’s how many hexadecimal digits fit in two bytes.

With that introduction, we’re ready to start exploring all the
<<values.adoc#,values that can be configured>>, and the full details of the
<<funcs.adoc#,functions that you can use for drawing>>.
