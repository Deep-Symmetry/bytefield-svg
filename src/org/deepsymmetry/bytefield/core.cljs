  "Draws an indication of discontinuity for a single-row diagram. Takes
  a single box. It does not make sense to use this in conjunction with
  either row or column headers because they will be incorrect. But
  some single-row diagrams can benefit from representing gaps in them,
  so this was requested.

  The default `:gap` distance (between the slanted edges of the
  discontinuity) is 5. The default `:gap-style` used to draw these gap
  edges is `:border-related`, and `:width` over which that gap is
  slanted defaults to 20. All these can be overridden through the
  optional attribute spec.

  The width of the edge drawn before and after the gap is calculated
  by subtracting the the gap width from the width of the single box
  into which this gap is drawn, so you will not get meaningful results
  if you try to specify a width that is greater than your configured
  box width.

  As with `draw-box`, the row height defaults to the predefined value
  `row-height` but can be overridden through `:height`. The background
  can be filled with a color passed with `:fill`.

  Since there are no clearly defined use cases that identify where and
  how to position any label, it is the responsibility of the

(defn default-row-header-fn
  "Returns an SVG text object containing the header for the current row
  in the default style, a hex value of at least two digits based on
  the current row address. If a gap has been generated, prefix that
  with _i+_ to indicate that it is relative to the first byte after
  the gap.

  This function is called with the current diagram state map. Defaults
  to the styling set up in the `:hex` attribute definition but with a
  font size of 11, explicitly \"normal\" font style, and dominant
  baseline of \"middle\", but these can be overridden by using
  `defattrs` to set up up an attribute spec named `:row-header`. Other
  SVG text attributes can be supplied in that attribute definition,
  and they will be passed along.

  The font family and style of the _i+_ post-gap prefix default to the
  values in the default `:math` attribute definition, but this can be
  overridden by setting `:math-family` and `:math-style` in the
  `:row-header` attribute definition."
